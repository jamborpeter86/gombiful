## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Use two browsers/devices** to test real-time sync
2. **Open browser console** to see Firebase connection status
3. **Check Firebase Console** to see data structure: https://console.firebase.google.com
4. **Room codes are case-insensitive** and auto-formatted

## 🚀 Ready to Continue?

When you're ready, say the word and I'll:
1. Create the DJ Control Panel (Phase 4)
2. Build the Player Mobile Interface (Phase 5)
3. Implement the game logic (Phases 6-7)
4. Polish and test (Phases 8-11)

**Estimated time to fully working multiplayer:** 4-6 more hours of development.
