# 🎮 Gombifül Multiplayer Mode - Development Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

**Goal**: Add a real-time multiplayer mode to Gombifül where a DJ/admin controls the game on a computer while players compete simultaneously on their mobile devices.

**Technology Stack**:
- React (Frontend)
- Firebase Firestore (Real-time database)
- Vite (Build tool)
- TailwindCSS + Lucide Icons (UI)

---

## 🎯 Core Requirements

### Game Flow
1. **DJ creates game session** → generates room code (e.g., "ABCD1234")
2. **Players join** using room code on mobile devices
3. **DJ starts game** → plays video on computer (all players in same room hear it)
4. **Players submit answers simultaneously** on their phones
5. **First player to 10 cards wins** → game ends, all players see final scores
6. **Keep existing single-player mode** as separate option

### Key Features
- ✅ **Same physical space** - no video sync needed
- ✅ **Simultaneous answering** - all players play at same time
- ✅ **Individual timelines** - each player builds their own
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - instant score updates
- ✅ **Mobile-first player UI** - optimized for phones
- ✅ **Desktop DJ UI** - full control panel

## 🔐 Firebase Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /games/{gameId} {
      // Anyone can read game data
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Only DJ can create/update game
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Players can update their own data
      allow update: if request.resource.data.players[request.auth.uid] != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Firestore Limits (Free Tier)
- **Reads**: 50,000/day
- **Writes**: 20,000/day
- **Deletes**: 20,000/day

### Optimization Strategies:
1. **Minimize reads**: Cache game state locally
2. **Batch writes**: Update multiple fields at once
3. **Cleanup**: Delete old games regularly
4. **Indexes**: Create indexes for queries

### Estimated Usage (per game):
- Create game: 1 write
- Join: 1 write per player
- Each round: 5-10 writes (answers + updates)
- 10-round game with 4 players: ~50 writes, ~200 reads

**Conclusion**: Free tier is sufficient for development and moderate use.

## 💡 Tips for Development

1. **Start simple**: Get basic lobby working before adding features
2. **Test frequently**: Use Firebase emulator for local testing
3. **Mobile-first**: Design player UI for phones from the start
4. **Use console.log liberally**: Firebase can be tricky to debug
5. **Save often**: Commit after each working feature
6. **Ask for help**: Firebase has great Stack Overflow coverage
