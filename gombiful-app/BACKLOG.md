## 🐛 Known Issues

### 🔴 Multiple Players Reconnection Issue
**Status:** OPEN
**Description:** When multiple players disconnect simultaneously (e.g., browser crash, network issue), only one player can see the "Resume Game" banner to reconnect. The localStorage only stores ONE session per browser, so if multiple players use different tabs on the same device, only the last session is saved.
**Impact:** Medium - Affects shared device scenarios or family/friend play sessions
**Potential Solutions:**
- Store multiple sessions in localStorage as an array
- Show a dropdown/list of available sessions to resume
- Use sessionStorage instead of localStorage for per-tab sessions
- Add "Switch Account" feature to choose which player to resume

---

## 🐛 Known Bugs (Resolved)

### ✅ White Screen After Join
**Fixed:** Added null safety checks for player data rendering.

### ✅ Auto-Navigation on Input
**Fixed:** Separated input state from join logic, requiring explicit button click.

### ✅ "Missing room code or player ID" Error
**Fixed:** Pass roomCode directly to joinGame function instead of relying on state timing.
